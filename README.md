## [Deductive Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_database)
Deductive databases combine logical programming with relational databases, and are capable of inferring new information from data stored in the database [memory banks](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011083/quotes); wherein multiplicative deductions are as elementary as Holmesian deduction, and are only bottlenecked by available storage capacity. Deductive databases can also be used as a form of data compression.

## [Datalog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)
Datalog is a turing-incomplete subset of Prolog, used as a query language for deductive databases.

### [DES](https://sourceforge.net/projects/des/)
